            <p>Nothing much to say here. I've never have interest in 
                Organization until college.
                <br>
                Ever since i was in elementary, i already so much invested on technology.
                <br>
                I dreamt to be able to make a game myself in future and Organization is just not my thing at that time.
                <br>
                Until i realize that one person cant make a Game that i dreamt themself.
                <br>
                Luckily i got accepted on an academic focused organization when i enter college, and thats the start of my life in Organization.
