            <img src="image/read.jpg" alt="reading">
            <p>I love to read to pass time. Theres some feel of relaxing whenever
                you read books about literature.
                <br> I like reading any books but
                i specifically love to read manga, and technology related.
                <br> I can read book anywhere the location, either in terrace or on wild accompanied by milk or some tea.
            </p>
            
            <h2>2. Watching</h2>
            <img src="image/watching.png" alt="watching">
            <p>Dont you love it to watch something? etiher in tv or your cellphone,
                movie will always good to watch for relaxing.
                <br> Action, comedy, fantasy is the genre i love to watch.
                Im more into animation since i really can freedom from the stories.
                <br> Being not limited to time and space is a good thing dont you think?
                Animation can just bend everything without worries, defying the law of physics.
                <br> I must say that watching anime is one of the things i like to do.
                Even basically freedom is translated to animation.
